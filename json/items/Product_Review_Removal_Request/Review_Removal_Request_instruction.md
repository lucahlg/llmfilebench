# Process and Analyze a Product Review

## Objective: 
The goal of this exercise is to practice manipulating and analyzing a JSON object representing a product review. You will be asked to modify the structure, add new information, and extract specific data points.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing a customer review for a product. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add Review Date:** Add a new property called "reviewDate" to the JSON object and assign it a value representing the date the review was submitted. Use the format "YYYY-MM-DD". For example: "2023-10-27".
2. **Categorize Reason:** Create a new property called "reasonCategory" and assign it a category that best describes the customer's reason for the negative review. Choose from the following options: "Quality", "Functionality", "Misrepresentation". In this case, the appropriate category would be "Misrepresentation".
3. **Extract Image URLs:** Create a new array called "imageUrls" and populate it with the URLs from the existing "supportingDocuments" array.
