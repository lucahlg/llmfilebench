# Modify a Video Game JSON Object

## Objective:

This exercise aims to familiarize you with manipulating and restructuring JSON data by adding, modifying, and removing properties within a video game object.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing information about the video game "The Last of Us Part II". Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new property**:  Include a `"developer"` field within the JSON object and assign it the value "Naughty Dog". 
2. **Update an existing property**: Change the `"mediaFormat"` to "Digital" reflecting the game's availability in digital storefronts.
3. **Modify array content**: Add "Horror" as a new genre to the `"genres"` array.
4. **Remove a property**: Delete the `"stock"` property from the JSON object as it is no longer relevant information.
5. **Restructure data:** Move the `"price"` and `"averageRating"` properties into a new nested object called `"salesInfo"`.
