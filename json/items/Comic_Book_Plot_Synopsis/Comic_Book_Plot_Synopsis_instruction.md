# Enhance a Story Database with JSON

## Objective:
This exercise focuses on enriching a JSON database representing the framework for an exciting space adventure story. You will be tasked with adding new information and structuring it appropriately within the existing JSON format.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file outlining the basic elements of "The Amazing Adventures of Captain Cosmos." Your mission is to expand this database with additional details:

1. **Introduce New Characters:**  Add two new characters to the "characters" array:
    - A loyal sidekick named "Astro" who assists Captain Cosmos, possessing exceptional technical skills and a witty personality.
    - A mysterious alien oracle named "Zenith" who holds ancient knowledge crucial to defeating Commander Nebula.

2. **Form a Heroic Team:** Create a new "teams" array and populate it with a single team:
   - Name the team "Cosmos Crusaders" and include Captain Cosmos and Astro as members.

3. **Explore New Locations:** Add two more locations to the "locations" array:
   - A bustling space station named "Cosmic Hub," known for its intergalactic trade and diverse alien population.
   - A hidden asteroid field called "Nebula's Graveyard," rumored to hold ancient artifacts and dangerous secrets.

4. **Outline Story Events:** Create a new "events" array and populate it with three initial events:
    - "Captain Cosmos encounters Commander Nebula for the first time."
    - "The Cosmos Crusaders journey to Cosmic Hub in search of clues."
    - "Astro discovers a hidden map leading to Nebula's Graveyard."



Remember to maintain the JSON structure and formatting while adding these new elements.
