# Modify a Calibration Record JSON

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify a JSON object representing a calibration record. You will be adding new information, updating existing data, and removing unnecessary entries.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing a calibration record for a specific instrument. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add Uncertainty:** Insert a new property called "uncertainty"  with a value of 0.5% to represent the uncertainty associated with the calibration.

2. **Update Calibration Agency:** Change the "calibrationAgency" to "Precision Calibration Services".

3. **Remove Measurement Standards:** Delete the entire "measurementStandards" array as this information is redundant given the presence of "referenceMaterials".

4. **Add Calibration Result:** Include a new property named "calibrationResult" with a value of "Pass".
