# Analyzing Product Test Results

## Objective:
This exercise aims to familiarize you with manipulating JSON data structures. You'll be analyzing product test results, adding new information, and updating existing data points.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing the test results for a product named "Acme SuperWidget." Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a New Test:** Include a new entry in the "tests" array representing an "Electrical Conductivity Test." 
    - Set the "result" to "Pass".
    - Write a brief descriptive comment under "comments", e.g., "The widget exhibited minimal electrical conductivity within acceptable parameters."

2. **Update an Existing Test:** The "Widget Durability Test" needs to be revised. Change the "result" from "Fail" to "Pass".  

3. **Extract Specific Data:** Create a new JSON object called "summary." Inside this object, store:
    - The total number of tests conducted (store this as the value for a key named "totalTests").
    - A list of all test names where the "result" is "Pass" (store this under a key named "passedTests").

4. **Modify Product Description:** Update the product description in the "product" section with the following text: "A revolutionary new widget engineered for exceptional performance and durability."
