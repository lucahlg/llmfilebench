# Modify a Shopping Cart JSON

## Objective:

This exercise focuses on manipulating data within a shopping cart represented as a JSON object. You will add, remove, and modify items within the cart.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a shopping cart. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a New Item:**  Insert a new item into the `cartItems` array. The new item should have the following properties:
    - `productId`: "GHI789"
    - `quantity`: 3

2. **Update Quantity:** Increase the quantity of the product with `productId`: "DEF456" to 2.

3. **Remove Item:** Remove the product with `productId`: "ABC123" from the `cartItems` array.

4. **Calculate New Total:** After the modifications in steps 1-3, recalculate the `cartTotal`. Assume each product has a price of $25.00. Update the `amount` field in the `cartTotal` object with the new total amount. Remember to consider the updated quantities.
