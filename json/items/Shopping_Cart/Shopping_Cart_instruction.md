# Analyze and Modify a Shopping Cart JSON

## Objective:
This exercise aims to strengthen your understanding of working with nested JSON data by performing modifications and analysis on a shopping cart structure.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing an online shopping cart. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Calculate the Total Cost:** Add a new property called "totalCost" to each item in the "items" array. Calculate this value by multiplying the "price" of the product by its "quantity".

2. **Update Product Quantity:** Change the quantity of the "Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra"  to 3.

3. **Extract Shipping Information:** Create a new JSON object called "shippingInfo". This object should contain the following fields extracted from the existing JSON:
    - "name": The shipping name from the "shippingAddress" object.
    - "address": The full shipping address (combine all relevant fields).

4. **Rename a Property:** Rename the "billingAddress" property to "paymentAddress".
