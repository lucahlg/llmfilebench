#  Managing Outtake Metadata

## Objective:

This exercise focuses on manipulating and updating metadata associated with an audio outtake. You will be adding, modifying, and restructuring information within a JSON object.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing metadata for an audio outtake. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add Timestamps:** Add two new properties to the JSON object: "start_time" (representing the starting timestamp of the outtake in seconds) and "end_time" (representing the ending timestamp of the outtake in seconds). Set both values to 0 for this exercise.
2. **Update Duration:** The duration of the outtake has been corrected to 45 seconds. Update the "duration" property accordingly.

3. **Add New Tag:** Add a new tag to the "tags" array: "conversation".
4. **Modify Notes:** Change the content of the "notes" field to: "This outtake features a hilarious conversation between the hosts about their favorite podcasting microphones."
