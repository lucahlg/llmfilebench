# Level Editor for a Temple Adventure Game

## Objective:

This exercise challenges you to modify and extend the JSON representation of a game level.  Your tasks will involve adjusting the level layout, adding new elements, and refining the overall experience.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a temple adventure game level. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a Challenge:** Insert a "trap" tile at coordinates (3, 5) within the "levelMap". This trap should hinder the player's progress. You can represent it simply as "trap" in the "tiles" array.

2. **Secret Passage:** Create a hidden passage by replacing three consecutive "wall" tiles with "empty" tiles starting at coordinates (7, 2).

3. **Treasure Relocation:** Modify the level so that the "exit" tile is now located at coordinates (9, 9).


4. **Difficulty Adjustment:** Change the "difficulty" setting to "hard".
5. **Time Estimate:** Update the "recommendedTime" to 45 minutes.
