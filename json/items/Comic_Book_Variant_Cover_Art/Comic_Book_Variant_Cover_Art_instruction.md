# Comic Book Data Manipulation

## Objective:

This exercise focuses on modifying and restructuring a JSON object representing comic book data. 

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file describing a variant cover for "The Amazing Spider-Man". Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add Issue Number:** Add a new property called "issueNumber" to the root of the JSON object and set its value to "1".
2. **Update Description:** Change the description of the variant cover to: "A stunning variant cover for The Amazing Spider-Man #1, showcasing Spider-Man in an action-packed pose with a redesigned costume." 
3. **Nest Creators:** Create a nested object called "creators" within the JSON. Move the information about the colorist, inker, and penciler into this new "creators" object.  Each creator should have its own sub-object (e.g., "colorist", "inker", "penciler") containing their name.
4. **Add Release Information:** Add a new property called "releaseDate" within the "publisher" object and set its value to "March 8, 2023".
