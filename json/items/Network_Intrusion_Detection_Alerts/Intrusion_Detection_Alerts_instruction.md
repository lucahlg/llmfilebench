# Analyze and Modify Security Alerts

## Objective: 
This exercise aims to enhance your understanding of JSON data structures by analyzing security alerts and performing targeted modifications.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing information about two security alerts. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Identify High-Risk Alerts:**  Determine which alert has the higher "riskScore". Update the "status" of this alert to "critical".
2. **Add New Comment:** For the alert with ID "9876543210", add a new comment to the "comments" array: "Review firewall logs for further analysis."
3. **Extract Alert Details:** Create a new JSON object called "summary" and store the following information from each alert:
    -  `id`: The alert ID 
    - `timestamp`: The timestamp of the alert
    - `severity`: The severity level of the alert
4. **Remove Unnecessary Fields:** Remove the "assignedTo" field from both alerts.

This exercise will help you practice manipulating JSON data, extracting specific information, and making strategic modifications based on analysis.
