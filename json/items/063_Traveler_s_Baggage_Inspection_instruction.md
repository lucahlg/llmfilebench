# Traveler Baggage Inspection Update

## Objective:

This exercise focuses on modifying a JSON object representing information about a traveler's baggage inspection. You will add new data, update existing fields, and restructure parts of the JSON to reflect changes in the inspection process.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing details about a traveler's baggage inspection. Your tasks are as follows:


1. **Add a new baggage item:** The traveler has added a new bag to their luggage. Append a new object to the "baggageItems" array. This new object should have a unique "id" (e.g., "89258433-0898-4371-81b1-935555343177"), and its "personalItems" array should contain the following items:
    -  "Books"

2. **Update inspection details:** The initial inspection revealed a prohibited item. Change the "inspectionResult" to "Flagged" to reflect this finding.

3. **Add detailed notes:** Provide more specific information about the flagged item in the "notes" field. For example:
    "A small pocketknife was found in one of the traveler's bags and confiscated."
