# Modify a Supplier Evaluation JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and restructure a supplier evaluation JSON object by adding new criteria, updating existing ratings and comments, and changing overall properties.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing an evaluation of a supplier. Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new criterion: Include a new rating and comments for "Customer service" with a rating of 4 and the following comment:
    - "Acme Corporation's customer service is generally responsive, but there have been some issues with communication and follow-up on orders."
2. Update an existing rating: Increase the overall rating to 5, reflecting improved performance across all criteria.
3. Restructure the data: Move the "notes" field into a nested object called "summary" with the structure:
    json	
    {
        "summary": {
            "overall_impression": "Acme Corporation is a strong supplier",
            "areas_for_improvement": ["cost-effectiveness"],
            "key_strengths": ["quality of products or services", "sustainability and social responsibility"]
        }
    }
4. Add a new property: Include a "recommendation" field with the following value:
    - "We highly recommend Acme Corporation as a supplier, but require closer monitoring of cost-effectiveness."
5. Remove a criterion: Remove the rating for "Innovation and technology" (rating = 4) from the criteria list.
