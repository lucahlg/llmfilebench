Here's an exercise instruction for the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend a Production Line Configuration
## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a production line configuration by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a production line configuration.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new station configuration: Add a new station called "Quality Control Station" with the following details:
    - id: "a9b45cde-7f32-49e4-bd6f-cba34567e89k"
    - name: "Quality Control Station"
    - stationTypeId: "QUALITY_CONTROL_STATION"
    - inputMaterialIds: ["86e601de-493a-49e2-bbdf-93340f2d0048"]
    - outputMaterialId: "c9e2df34-7cb1-45ba-a98e-d4b3cf56dcba"

Add this new station configuration to the end of the existing stations array.

2. Update an existing property: The production line type has been updated to "PACKAGING_LINE". Update the "productionLineTypeId" field to reflect this change.

3. Remove a station: Remove the "Inspection Station 1" from the JSON object.

4. Restructure the data: Move the "stationConfigurations" array into a nested object called "production_line" with the structure:
```json
{
    "id": "...",
    "name": "...",
    "productionLineTypeId": "...",
    "production_line": {
        [...]
    }
}
```

Your modified JSON should have the updated fields, removed station, and restructured data.
