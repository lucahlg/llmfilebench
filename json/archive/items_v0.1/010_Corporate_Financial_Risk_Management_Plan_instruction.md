# Modify and Extend a Risk Management Plan JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a risk management plan JSON object by adding new elements, updating existing values, and reorganizing the structure.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a risk management plan for Acme Corporation. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new risk management strategy**: Add a new strategy to the "risk_management_strategies" array. The new strategy should be:
    - "Maintain a robust cybersecurity framework"
2. **Update an existing control procedure**: Update one of the existing control procedures in the "control_procedures" arrays for both the "Investment Policy" and "Foreign Currency Hedging Policy" controls. For example, update the first procedure for "Investment Policy" to include a new step:
    - "Conduct regular stress tests on investments"
3. **Remove an unnecessary element**: Remove one of the redundant objectives from the "control_objectives" arrays for both the "Investment Policy" and "Foreign Currency Hedging Policy" controls.
4. **Reorganize reporting content**: Update the "reporting_content" field in the "risk_management_reporting" object to include a new section on:
    - "Key performance indicators (KPIs) for risk management"
5. **Add a new recipient to reporting list**: Add a new entity to the "reporting_recipients" array, which should be responsible for receiving the quarterly reports.

This exercise requires you to analyze the existing JSON structure, identify areas that need modification or extension, and make the necessary changes to create a more comprehensive risk management plan.
