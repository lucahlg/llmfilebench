Here's an exercise instruction for the given JSON object:

# Modify and Refine a Person's Profile JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and refine a person's profile JSON object by updating, removing, and restructuring properties. You will also be asked to extract specific information from the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a person's contact information.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Update the relationship status: Change the "relationship" property to "Partner".
2. Add a new contact method: Insert a new field called "smsNumber" under the "contactInfo" object with value "(555) 123-4567".
3. Remove redundant information: Delete the "suffix" field from the "name" object.
4. Restructure the address: Move the "streetAddress", "city", and "zipCode" fields into a separate nested object called "physicalLocation" under the "address" property, keeping the existing structure for state.
5. Extract information: Use a JSON parser to extract the person's first name from the JSON object.

Note that this exercise focuses on modifying and refining an existing JSON structure, rather than adding entirely new properties or arrays. It also involves extracting specific data from the JSON, which requires understanding of JSON parsing concepts.
