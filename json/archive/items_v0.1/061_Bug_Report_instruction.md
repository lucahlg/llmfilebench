Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend an Incident Report JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend an incident report JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing an incident report.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new property: Add a new property called "summary" to the JSON. The "summary" should contain a brief description of the issue (less than 50 characters).
2. Update existing properties: John Smith has reported that the login page is working now. Update the "status" and "priority" fields accordingly.
3. Remove an attachment: One of the attachments, Screenshot.png, is not necessary anymore. Remove it from the JSON object.
4. Restructure comments: Move all comments into a nested array called "incident_history". The structure should be:
json	
"incident_history": [
    {
        "user": "John Smith",
        "comment": "I am unable to log in to the system.",
        "date": "2023-03-08T14:30:00Z"
    }
]
5. Add a new comment: As an assignee, Jane Doe has added a comment. You should add it to the "incident_history" array with her username and current date.

## Bonus Task:
Bonus task! You've decided that this incident is actually minor instead of major. Update the "severity" field accordingly. 

This exercise requires the student to modify and extend the JSON object, update existing values, remove unnecessary data, restructure part of the JSON, and add new properties or comments as needed.
