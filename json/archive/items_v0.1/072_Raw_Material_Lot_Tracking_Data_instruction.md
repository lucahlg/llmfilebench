Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend Raw Material Tracking Data

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a raw material tracking data JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing raw material lot tracking data.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new property: Add a new property called "productionDate" to the JSON object. The production date should be in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD".
2. Update an existing property: The quantity of the raw material has changed. Update the "quantity" field to reflect this change.
3. Remove a property: Remove the "notes" field from the JSON object, as it is no longer relevant.
4. Restructure the data: Move the "manufacturer" and "supplier" fields into a nested object called "vendorInfo" with the structure:
```json
"vendorInfo": {
    "manufacturer": "Acme Corporation",
    "supplier": "XYZ Suppliers"
}
```
5. Modify an array element: Remove one of the attachments from the "attachments" array. You can choose which attachment to remove.

Note: Be sure to update the JSON object accordingly, and do not modify the existing structure or formatting unless explicitly instructed to do so.
