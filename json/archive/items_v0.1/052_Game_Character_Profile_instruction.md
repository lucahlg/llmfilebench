Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Enhance an Adventurer's Profile
## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and enhance an adventurer's profile by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing an adventurer.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new skill: Add a new skill called "Stealth" to the "skills" array. The "Stealth" skill should have a level of 3.
2. Update the equipment durability: The adventurer's Silver Sword has taken some wear and tear, reducing its durability to 60. Update the "weapon" object accordingly.
3. Add a new stat: The adventurer has been training in magic and wants to track their spellcasting progress. Add a new stat called "magical power" with a value of 20.
4. Remove an unnecessary quest: The adventurer has completed the "Find the Lost Treasure" quest, but no longer sees it as relevant. Remove this quest from the "quests" array.
5. Restructure the stats: Move the health and mana fields into a nested object called "physical_stats" with the structure:
```json
"stats": {
    "physical_stats": {
        "health": 80,
        "mana": 50
    },
    "mental_stats": {
        "strength": 60,
        "agility": 70,
        "intelligence": 40
    }
}
```
Note: You can modify any part of the JSON object to complete this exercise, but make sure to follow the instructions carefully and test your solution thoroughly.
