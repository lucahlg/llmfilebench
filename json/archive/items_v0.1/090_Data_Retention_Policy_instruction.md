Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend Data Retention Policies

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend existing data retention policies by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the policy.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a set of data retention policies.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new policy: Create a new "retentionPolicy" object with the following details:
   - name: "HR Data Retention Policy"
   - duration: 60
   - retentionPeriodUnit: "MONTHS"
   - description: "This policy retains HR data for 2 months."

2. Update an existing policy: The Customer Data Retention Policy needs to be updated to retain customer data for 45 days instead of 30.
3. Add a new field to all policies: Include a new field called "dataType" in each retention policy, with the value "personal" for the Customer Data Retention Policy and "financial" for the Financial Data Retention Policy, and "HR" for the new HR Data Retention Policy.

4. Restructure the data: Move the description of each policy into a nested object called "policyDetails". The policyDetails object should have the structure:
   json
   {
       "description": "",
       "startDate": "",
       "endDate": ""
   }

Note that you will need to update the existing policies according to the new requirements, and make sure not to alter the existing data unnecessarily.
