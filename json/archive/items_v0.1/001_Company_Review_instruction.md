Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Enrich Company Information

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and enrich company information by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing company review data.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new property called "numberOfEmployees" to the JSON object. The "numberOfEmployees" should contain an integer value indicating the number of employees working at Acme Corporation.
2. Update the "rating" object by changing the "productQuality" rating from 5 to 4.5, and keeping the other ratings unchanged.
3. Add a new property called "industryType" to the JSON object. The "industryType" should contain a string value indicating the type of industry Acme Corporation operates in (e.g., technology, finance, healthcare).
4. Remove the "companyPhoneNumber" field from the JSON object, as it is not essential for the review data.
5. Restructure the rating information by moving the individual ratings ("overall", "productQuality", and "customerService") into a separate nested object called "individualRatings".

Have fun!
