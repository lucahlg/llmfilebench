# Modify and Extend a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing an NDA agreement between two parties.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new section: Add a new section called "representatives" to the JSON object. The "representatives" section should contain the following fields for each party:
    - "name"
    - "title"
    - "email"
2. Update an existing property: Change the expiration date from 2024-02-28 to 2025-01-31.
3. Remove a section: Remove the "termination" section from the JSON object.
4. Restructure the data: Move the "governingLaw", "disputes", and "term" fields into a nested object called "agreement_terms" with the structure:
```json
"agreement_terms": {
    "governingLaw": "...",
    "disputes": "...",
    "term": "..."
}
```
5. Add a new confidential information item: Add a new item to the "confidentialInformation" array for XYZ Company with the following details:
    - description: "The product roadmap of XYZ Company."
    - category: "Product information"
    - deliveryMethod: "electronic"
    - deliveryDate: "2023-04-01"

Note that you may need to modify existing fields or add new ones as required by the tasks above. Good luck!
