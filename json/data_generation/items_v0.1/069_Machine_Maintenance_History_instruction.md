Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend a Maintenance Record JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a maintenance record JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a maintenance record.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new property: Add a new property called "additionalServices" to the JSON. The "additionalServices" should contain an array of strings, listing any additional services performed during the maintenance, such as:
    - "Oil change"
    - "Tire rotation"
    - "Battery replacement"
2. Modify an existing property: Update the "maintenanceDate" property to reflect a new date (use your imagination!).
3. Remove a property: Remove the "notes" field from the JSON object.
4. Restructure the data: Move the "attachments" array into a separate nested object called "supportingDocuments", with the structure:
```
{
    "maintenanceRecord": {
        // existing fields...
    },
    "supportingDocuments": [
        {
            // attachment fields...
        }
    ]
}
5. Update attachments: Add a new attachment to the "supportingDocuments" array, with the following details:
    - attachmentName: "Updated Maintenance Report"
    - attachmentType: "Document"
    - attachmentUrl: "https://example.com/updated-maintenance-report.pdf"

Note: Make sure to preserve any existing data and structure when making changes!
