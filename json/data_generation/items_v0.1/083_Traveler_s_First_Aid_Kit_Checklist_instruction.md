Here's an exercise instruction for the given JSON object:

# Modify and Reorganize a Patient Profile JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and reorganize a patient profile JSON object by adding new properties, updating existing values, and restructing the data.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a patient's medical profile. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Medical Conditions**: Update the dosage of the "Asthma" condition to "3 puffs every 4 hours as needed". Also, add a new field called "physician_notes" to both conditions, containing any relevant notes from the physician.
2. **Add New Emergency Contact**: Add a new emergency contact named "Emily Chen" with her email ("emily.chen@example.com"), phone number ("555-456-7890"), and relationship ("Sister").
3. **Modify Owner Information**: Update the owner's name to "Sarah Johnson". Also, add a new property called "SSN" (Social Security Number) to the owner object.
4. **Reorganize Supplies**: Instead of having separate supplies for each type (e.g., bandages, gauze, etc.), restructure the supplies to have a single array of items with quantity fields for each item. For example:
```json
"supplies": [
  {
    "name": "Bandages",
    "quantity": 10
  },
  {
    "name": "Gauze",
    "quantity": 5
  },
  ...
]
```
5. **Remove Redundant Information**: Remove the redundant "phone" field from the emergency contact array, as each contact already has a phone number associated with them.

By completing these tasks, you will have successfully modified and reorganized the patient profile JSON object according to the requirements outlined above.
