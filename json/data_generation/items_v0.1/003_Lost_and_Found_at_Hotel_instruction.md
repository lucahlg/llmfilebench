Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend a Lost Item Report JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a lost item report JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a lost item report.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new property**: Add a new property called "lastSeenLocation" to the JSON object. The "lastSeenLocation" should contain the following fields:
    - "street": "Any Street"
    - "city": "New York City"
    - "zip": "10001"
2. **Update an existing property**: Update the "foundDate" of the item from "2023-03-08" to a new date (you choose).
3. **Restructure the data**: Move the "finderContact" and "notes" fields into separate nested objects called "finder_info" and "additional_details", respectively.
    - "finder_info": {
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
        "phone": "123-456-7890"
    }
    - "additional_details": {
        "notes": "The wallet was found on a bench near the playground."
    }
4. **Add a new field to an existing object**: Add a new field called "condition" to the "itemDescription" object with a value of "Good".
5. **Remove a property**: Remove the redundant information from the "finderContact" field and instead, update the "name" in the "finder_info" object to reflect that it's actually her who found the item.

I hope this exercise instruction fits your needs!
