Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Enhance and Filter a Book Review JSON Object
## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to enhance and filter a book review JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a book review.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new property called "rating" to the JSON. The rating should contain the following fields:
    - "overall": 4
    - "recommendation": true
2. Update the author's bio: Change the "bio" field of the "author" object to include a mention of Douglas Adams' other notable works.
3. Remove unnecessary categories: Remove any category that is not "Science Fiction".
4. Restructure comments: Move the comment section into a separate nested object called "reviews" with the structure:
json
"reviews": [
    {
        "author": {
            "name": "John Smith"
        },
        "content": "This is a great book! I laughed out loud several times.",
        "date": "2023-03-08",
        "rating": 5
    },
    {
        "author": {
            "name": "Jane Doe"
        },
        "content": "I didn't really get the humor. I thought it was kind of boring.",
        "date": "2023-03-09",
        "rating": 2
    }
]
5. Filter out comments: Remove any comment that has a rating less than 4.

Note: You can assume that you are working with an array of reviews and should filter the existing ones according to the instruction.
