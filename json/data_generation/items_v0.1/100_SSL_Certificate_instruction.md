Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Update a SSL Certificate Configuration JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and update a JSON object representing a SSL certificate configuration. You will be asked to add, remove, and restructure properties.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a SSL certificate configuration.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new CA**: Add a new "certificateAuthority" property with the following details:
    - name: "GlobalSign"
    - email: "ssl@globalsign.com"
    - website: "https://www.globalsign.com"
2. **Update validity period**: Update the "validityPeriod" object to reflect an extended certificate validity period, starting from "2023-03-08" and ending on "2027-03-07".
3. **Remove subject alternative names**: Remove all subject alternative names (SANs) from the JSON object.
4. **Change key algorithm**: Update the "keyAlgorithm" property to use a more secure encryption method, such as "EC_256".
5. **Restructure renewal period**: Move the "renewal" object into a nested "certificateConfiguration" structure with the following details:
    json	
        {
            "certificationDetails": {
                ...
            },
            "configurationOptions": {
                "renewal": {
                    "enabled": true,
                    "period": {
                        "years": 2,
                        "months": 0,
                        "days": 0
                    }
                }
            }
        }

This exercise requires you to manipulate the given JSON object by adding new properties, updating existing values, and restructuring the data.
