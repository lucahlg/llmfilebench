# Modify and Update a Game Store Inventory JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and update a game store inventory JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a video game's information. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update the game price**: The publisher has decided to decrease the price of the game by $10. Update the "price" field to reflect this change.
2. **Add a new platform**: The game is now also available on the Xbox console. Add a new platform to the "platforms" array with the value "Xbox".
3. **Remove the media format**: Since the game's media format is no longer relevant, remove the "mediaFormat" field from the JSON object.
4. **Restructure the publisher information**: Move the publisher name and location into a nested object called "publisher_info" with the following structure:
    ```json
    "publisher_info": {
        "name": "Sony Interactive Studios",
        "location": "San Mateo, California"
    }
    ```
5. **Update the average rating**: The game has received new reviews, and its average rating has increased to 4.8. Update the "averageRating" field with this new value.

Your task is to manipulate the JSON object using your programming skills to achieve these modifications. Good luck!
