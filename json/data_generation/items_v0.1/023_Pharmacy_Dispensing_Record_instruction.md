**# Modify and Extend a Patient Medication Prescription**

## **Objective:**
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a patient medication prescription JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## **Exercise Instructions:**

You are provided with a JSON file representing a patient's medication prescription.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Medication Details:** The patient has been prescribed a new medication called "Ibuprofen". Update the "medication" object to reflect this change, including its dosage and frequency.
2. **Add New Prescription Instructions:** Add a new field called "specialInstructions" to the JSON object under "patient". This should contain any specific instructions for taking the medication.
3. **Remove Unnecessary Fields:** Remove the "qualification" property from the "prescriber" object, as it is not necessary for this particular prescription.
4. **Restructure Prescription Data:** Move the "dispensingDate", "quantityDispensed", and "refillsAllowed" fields into a nested object called "dispensationInfo". The resulting JSON should look like this:
```json
"dispensationInfo": {
  "dispensingDate": "2023-03-08",
  "quantityDispensed": 30,
  "refillsAllowed": 2
}
```
5. **Add Prescription Signature:** Add a new field called "signatureVerified" to the JSON object under "prescriber". This should be set to true, indicating that the prescriber has verified their signature.

## **Deliverables:**
Please provide the modified JSON object with all tasks completed.
