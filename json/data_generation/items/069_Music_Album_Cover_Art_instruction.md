# Album Metadata Modification

## Objective:

This exercise focuses on modifying and restructuring a JSON object representing album metadata. You will be adding new information, updating existing values, and rearranging the structure to better reflect the data.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file describing a vinyl record album.  Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Artist Information:** Change the artist's age to 28.
2. **Add Tracklist:** Create a new property called "tracklist" within the main JSON object. This property should be an array containing the titles of the album's tracks.  Include at least five track titles.

3. **Restructure Artwork Information:** Move the "albumArt" object from inside "artwork" to become a direct child of the "vinyl" object.
4. **Add Genre:** Add a new property called "genre" within the main JSON object and set its value to "Grunge".
