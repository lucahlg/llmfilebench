#  Modifying a Shopping Cart JSON

## Objective:

The goal of this exercise is to simulate modifications to a shopping cart represented by a JSON object. You will add items, adjust quantities, and ensure the cart adheres to defined limitations.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a shopping cart. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new item:** Insert a new item into the "items" array. The new item should have the following properties:
    -  `"itemId": "item_3"`
    - `"quantity": 3`
    - `"maxAllowedQuantity": 8"`

2. **Increase quantity:** Increase the `quantity` of the item with `itemId: "item_1"` by 2. Ensure the updated quantity does not exceed the  `maxAllowedQuantity`.

3. **Remove an item:** Delete the item with `itemId: "item_2"` from the "items" array.
