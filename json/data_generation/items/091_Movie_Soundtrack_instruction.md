# Modify and Enhance a Movie Database JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and enhance a movie database JSON object by adding new properties, updating existing values, reorganizing the structure, and improving data consistency.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a movie database. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new genre**: Add a new property called "rating" to the "genres" array in the "movie" object. The rating should be based on IMDB ratings (e.g., "9.2/10"). Make sure to update the existing genres with their respective ratings.
2. **Update the soundtrack**: Update the length of the second soundtrack song, "Brooks Was Here", from 120 seconds to 240 seconds.
3. **Improve artist information**: Create a new property called "awards" in each artist object and add relevant awards won by Thomas Newman and James Newton Howard (e.g., "Academy Award Nomination for Best Original Score").
4. **Restructure the movie data**: Move the "runtime" property from the top-level "movie" object to a new nested object called "production_details".
5. **Enhance consistency**: Update all cast member names in the "cast" array to have their last name capitalized (e.g., "Tim Robbins" becomes "Tim ROBBINS").

Note: Make sure to follow proper JSON formatting and syntax when performing these tasks.
