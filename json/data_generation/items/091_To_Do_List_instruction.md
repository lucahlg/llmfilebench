#  Todo List Management with JSON

## Objective:
This exercise focuses on manipulating a todo list represented in JSON format. You will practice adding, modifying, and deleting tasks while understanding the hierarchical structure of the data.

## Exercise Instructions:

1. **Add a New Task:** Insert a new task into the "tasks" array. The new task should have the following details:
    -  `"id"`: `"4"`
    - `"title"`: `"Practice JSON Manipulation"` 
    - `"description"`: `"Complete exercises to improve my JSON skills."`
    - `"priority"`: `"high"`
    - `"due_date"`: `"2023-03-15"`
    - `"completed"`: `false`

2. **Mark a Task as Completed:** Update the "completed" status of the task with  `"id"`: `"2"` (Build a website) to `true`.

3. **Change Task Priority:** Modify the "priority" of the task with `"id"`: `"3"` (Get a new job) from `"low"` to `"medium"`. 


4. **Remove an Existing Task:** Delete the task with  `"id"`: `"1"` (Learn JSON) from the "tasks" array.
