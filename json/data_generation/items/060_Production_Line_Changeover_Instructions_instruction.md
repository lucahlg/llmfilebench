Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Enhance Changeover Instructions for XYZ Production Line
## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and enhance the changeover instructions for the XYZ production line by adding new details, updating existing information, and reorganizing the structure.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing the changeover instructions for the XYZ production line. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new product**: Add a new product called "Product D" to the "products" array within the "productionLine" object. The new product should have a description.
2. **Update a step's prerequisites and materials**: Update the prerequisites and materials for Step 3 to reflect changes in the production process. Specifically, add a new prerequisite related to regulatory compliance and update the materials list to include specific types of gloves.
3. **Add a new safety consideration**: Add a new safety consideration to the "safetyProcedures" array emphasizing the importance of regular equipment maintenance.
4. **Restructure the 'changeoverSteps' array**: Move the "estimatedTime", "prerequisites", "materials", and "safetyConsiderations" fields from each step into a nested object called "details". Keep the original formatting as much as possible.
5. **Remove outdated information**: Remove the "additionalInformation" field from the JSON, as it's no longer relevant to the current production process.

Note: Be creative with your updates and reorganizations! The goal is to showcase your understanding of JSON manipulation while providing clear instructions for others to follow.
