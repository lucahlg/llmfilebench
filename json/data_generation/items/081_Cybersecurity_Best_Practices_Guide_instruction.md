Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

**# Extend and Refine a Security Framework JSON**

## **Objective:**
The goal of this exercise is to extend and refine a security framework JSON by adding new guidelines, updating existing information, and modifying the structure.

## **Exercise Instructions:**

You are provided with a JSON file representing a security framework. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new guideline**: Add a new guideline called "Compliance" to the JSON object. The "Compliance" guideline should have the following properties:
	* title: "Compliance"
	* description: "This guideline provides recommendations for ensuring compliance with relevant regulations and standards."
	* controls: [
		{
			name: "Conduct regular audits",
			description: "Conduct regular audits to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards."
		},
		{
			name: "Maintain accurate records",
			description: "Maintain accurate and up-to-date records of all security-related activities."
		}
	]
2. **Update an existing author**: Update the name of one of the authors from "Alice" to "Alicia".
3. **Add a new version**: Add a new property called "nextVersion" with the value "1.0.1". The "nextVersion" should indicate the next planned version of the security framework.
4. **Restructure the controls**: Move all the control descriptions from the individual guidelines to a separate nested object called "controlDescriptions".
5. **Remove an existing property**: Remove the "version" property from the JSON object.

Note: You are free to choose which properties or values you want to update, add, or remove as part of this exercise.
