Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend a Product Review System

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a product review system by adding, updating, and removing properties in both products and reviews JSON objects. You will also be asked to restructure part of the data.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a product catalog and its associated reviews.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new property called "description" to each product in the "products" array. The description should contain a brief summary of the product (e.g., "An awesome electronic device").
2. Update the average rating of the "Awesome Product" to 4.7 and increase its number of reviews by 20.
3. Add a new review for the "Fantastic Gadget". The review should have the following details:
    - Rating: 5
    - Title: "Excellent Choice!"
    - Content: "I recently purchased this gadget, and I'm thoroughly impressed with its performance."
    - Date: "2023-06-20"
4. Move the "rating" field from each review into a separate nested object called "review_info" with the structure:
    json	
        "review_info": {
            "rating": [insert rating value]
        }
5. Remove the "title" field from the reviews JSON object.

This exercise requires manipulating and restructuring both products and reviews data, making it an excellent opportunity for students to practice working with nested JSON objects and arrays.
