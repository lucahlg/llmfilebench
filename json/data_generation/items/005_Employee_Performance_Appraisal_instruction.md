# Analyze and Modify Employee Appraisal Data

## Objective: 
The goal of this exercise is to analyze and modify a JSON object representing an employee appraisal. You will be adding new information, updating existing data, and restructuring parts of the JSON.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing data about an employee's performance review. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add Training Recommendation:** Add a new property called "trainingRecommendations" to the JSON object. This property should be an array containing objects, each representing a recommended training course.  The first object in this array should have the following structure:
    - "courseName": "Effective Communication Strategies"
    - "courseDuration": "2 Days"

2. **Update Overall Rating:** The employee has shown exceptional improvement since their last appraisal. Update the "ratingValue" within the "overallRating" object to 5.

3. **Add New Category:**  Add a new category to the "categories" array. This new category should have:
    - "categoryId": "CAT-04"
    - "categoryName": "Leadership" 

4. **Remove Comments:** Remove the entire "comments" property from the JSON object.
