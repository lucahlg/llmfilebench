# Modify and Enrich a Comic Book Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and enrich a comic book JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a comic book variant cover.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new property**: Add a new property called "artist" to the JSON object. The "artist" should contain the following fields:
    - "name": Ryan Stegman
    - "role": Penciler and Cover Artist
2. **Update an existing field**: Update the published date of the comic book to reflect the correct format (YYYY-MM-DD). Ensure that the value is correct for March 8, 2023.
3. **Remove a property**: Remove the "description" field from the JSON object.
4. **Restructure the data**: Move the "publisher" and "series" fields into a nested object called "metadata" with the structure:
    json
    "metadata": {
        "publisher": {
            "name": "Marvel Comics"
        },
        "series": {
            "title": "The Amazing Spider-Man"
        }
    }

Note: Ensure that you keep all other properties and values intact throughout these modifications.
