# Modify and Extend a Hiring Plan JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a hiring plan JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a hiring plan for software engineers.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Hiring Goal**: Update the "goal" property to reflect an increased target of hiring 15 qualified software engineers within 9 months.
2. **Add New Talent Pool**: Add a new talent pool called "Alumni Network" with the following details:
	* name: "Alumni Network"
	* description: "Existing alumni who are interested in returning to the company as software engineers."
	* size: 30
	* quality: "good"
3. **Modify Sourcing Channel**: Update the effectiveness of the "Employee Referrals" sourcing channel from "high" to "very high".
4. **Restructure Hiring Managers**: Move the hiring managers into a nested object called "managers" within the "hiringManagers" array, with each manager having an additional property called "experience" containing their number of years of experience in software engineering.
5. **Add New Benefit**: Add a new benefit to the "offer" benefits list: "Stock options".

Your modified JSON should be a valid representation of the hiring plan with these changes incorporated.
