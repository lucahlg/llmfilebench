Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend Test Kit JSON
## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a test kit JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a set of test kits.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new test kit**: Add a new test kit to the "testKits" array with the following details:
    - name: "NewTestKit"
    - instructions: Update the existing steps in the "instructions" object by adding a new step at the beginning of the list.
        * The first step should be "Review the test kit documentation."
    - warnings: Add a new warning to the "warnings" array with the text: "This new test kit requires administrative privileges."

2. **Update an existing property**: Update the "name" field in the original test kit by changing it to "UpdatedTestKit".

3. **Remove a property**: Remove the entire "instructions" object from the original test kit.

4. **Restructure the data**: Move the "warnings" array into a separate JSON object called "metadata" with the structure:
    json
    "testKits": [
        {
            ...
        }
    ],
    "metadata": {
        "version": 1,
        "warnings": [
            ...
        ]
    }

Note: Make sure to modify only the specified fields and avoid adding or modifying any other properties in the JSON object.
