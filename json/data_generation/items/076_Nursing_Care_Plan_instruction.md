This JSON data represents a structured record of a patient's care plan. Let's break down the components:

**1. Diagnoses:**

*   **Risk for Pressure Ulcers:** This diagnosis highlights the patient's vulnerability to developing pressure sores due to immobility. Risk factors like poor nutrition and advanced age further contribute.
*   **Impaired Physical Mobility:**  This diagnosis indicates the patient faces difficulty moving around independently, potentially caused by conditions like arthritis, stroke, or Parkinson's disease. Related factors such as pain, weakness, and fatigue exacerbate this issue.

**2. Goals:**

*   **Maintain skin integrity:** The primary aim is to prevent pressure ulcers from developing, ensuring the patient's skin remains intact and healthy.
*   **Improve physical mobility:** This goal focuses on enhancing the patient's ability to move independently, possibly with the aid of assistive devices like a walker.

**3. Interventions:**

These are specific actions taken to address the diagnoses and achieve the goals:

*   **Turn and reposition patient:** Regularly changing the patient's position relieves pressure on bony prominences, crucial for preventing pressure ulcers.
*   **Pressure-relieving mattress:** Providing a specialized mattress further reduces pressure and promotes skin health.
*   **Range of motion exercises:** Maintaining joint flexibility through exercises helps improve overall mobility.
*   **Ambulation with assistive device:** Assisting the patient in walking using a walker or cane encourages independence and strengthens muscles.

**4. Evaluations:**

*   These entries document the progress towards achieving the goals:
    * **Skin integrity evaluation:** Confirms that the patient's skin remains intact without any pressure ulcers.
    * **Mobility evaluation:** Shows that the patient has successfully progressed to ambulating independently with a walker.

**Structure and Significance:**


This structured JSON format allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis of patient care information.  Healthcare providers can use this data to:

*   Track progress towards goals
*   Identify areas needing further attention
*   Make informed decisions about treatment adjustments
*   Share information seamlessly between different healthcare professionals involved in the patient's care
