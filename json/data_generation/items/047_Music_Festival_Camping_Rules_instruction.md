Here's an exercise instruction for modifying a JSON file representing a music festival:

# Modify and Extend a Music Festival JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a JSON object representing a music festival by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing the Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) music festival.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new event**: Add a new event called "EDC After Dark" to the JSON object. The "EDC After Dark" event should have the following details:
    - dates: "June 19-21, 2023"
    - location: "Las Vegas, Nevada"
    - campingRules: []
2. **Update existing rules**: Update the "Quiet hours" rule in the EDC festival's camping rules to reflect a new start time of 11pm.
3. **Remove unnecessary data**: Remove the "penalty" field from all camping rules.
4. **Restructure event information**: Move the "dates" and "location" fields into a nested object called "event_info" for both EDC and EDC After Dark events.

## Additional Requirements:
Make sure to validate your JSON output to ensure it's free of errors and follows standard practices.

This exercise requires students to manipulate the given JSON, adding new data, updating existing properties, removing unnecessary information, and restructuring part of the JSON. The additional requirements encourage them to think about validation and best practices in their code.
