# Casting Call Modification

## Objective:

You will be modifying a JSON object representing a casting call for an upcoming feature film. Your tasks will involve updating existing information, adding new roles, and restructuring some data.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing details about a casting call. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Audition Details:** Change the audition date to "2023-04-05" and the audition time to "1:00 PM".
2. **Add a New Role:** Include a new supporting role called "Emily," Sarah's best friend.  Provide the following details for Emily's role:
    *   **Description:** A loyal and supportive friend who encourages Sarah throughout her journey.

    *   **Age Range:** 18-23

    *   **Gender:** Female

    *   **Ethnicity:** Open to all ethnicities

    *   **NumLines:** 25
    *   **Speaking Role:** True
3. **Restructure Compensation Information:** Move the "compensation" information into a new object called "contract" within the main JSON object.  This "contract" object should also include a new field called "benefits" and set its value to "Health Insurance". 

4. **Remove Unnecessary Fields:** Remove the "contactPhone" field from the JSON object as it is no longer needed.

Follow these steps carefully to modify the casting call JSON object accurately. Make sure your final output reflects all the requested changes and adheres to proper JSON formatting.
