# Analyze and Enhance Telehealth Technology Specifications

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to analyze a JSON object containing specifications for a telehealth technology and perform modifications to enhance its clarity and completeness. 

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a telehealth technology named "Telehealth Technology X." Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add Detailed Feature Descriptions:** Expand the "additionalFeatures" array by adding a brief description for each feature (screen sharing, file sharing, text chat). For example, "Screen sharing: Allows healthcare providers to share their screen with patients for demonstrations or visual explanations."

2. **Categorize Supported Platforms:**  Create a new property called "platformCategories" within the JSON object. This property should be an array containing two string elements: "Desktop" and "Mobile."

3. **Enhance Security Information:** Add a new property called "encryptionMethod" to specify the encryption method used by the TLS security protocol (e.g., AES-256).

4. **Update Video Resolution:** Change the "videoResolution" value to "720p" to reflect a more common and accessible resolution for telehealth applications.
