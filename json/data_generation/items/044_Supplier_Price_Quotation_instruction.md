# Update and Analyze a Quotation JSON Object

## Objective:

The goal of this exercise is to modify and analyze a quotation JSON object representing a business transaction. You will update specific values, add new information, and calculate a key metric based on the existing data.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing a quotation for various items. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Item Price:** Change the unit price of "Widget B" (itemId: "ITEM-1002") to 17.5.
2. **Add Discount:** Add a new property called "discountPercentage" to the JSON object with a value of 5. This represents a 5% discount on the total cost.

3. **Calculate Discounted Cost:** Create a new property called "discountedCost". Calculate this value by subtracting the discount (5% of "totalCost") from the original "totalCost".
4. **Change Expiration Date:** Update the "expirationDate" to "2023-07-15".
