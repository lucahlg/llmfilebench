Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Enhance an Advertiser JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and enhance a JSON object representing an advertiser by adding new properties, updating existing values, and reorganizing the structure.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing information about an advertiser. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Business Information**: Update the "name" of the advertiser to "Acme Corp." and change the "address" format to include only the city and state (e.g., "Anytown, CA"). Add a new property called "industry" with the value "Technology".
2. **Enhance Podcast Details**: Add two new fields to the "podcast" object: "genre" with the value "Interviews" and "language" with the value "English". Update the "category" field to include a subcategory, e.g., "Business -> Marketing".
3. **Refine Agreement Terms**: Remove the "cancellationTerms" property from the "agreement" object. Add a new property called "taxRate" with the value 8 (representing an 8% tax rate). Update the "startDate" and "endDate" fields to reflect the current year.
4. **Improve Note-taking**: Move the "notes" field into a nested object called "communications", which should include the original "notes" text along with a new property called "contactMethod" with the value "Email".

This exercise will test your students' ability to manipulate and restructure JSON data, while also introducing them to more complex nesting and formatting requirements.
