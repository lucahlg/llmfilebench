Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend an Insurance Plan JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend an insurance plan JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing an insurance plan.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new benefit: Add a new benefit called "Short-Term Disability Insurance" to the "benefits" array. The new benefit should have the following details:
	* name: "Short-Term Disability Insurance"
	* description: "Provides coverage for short-term disability benefits."
	* cost: 75
	* coverage: "Short-Term"
2. Update an existing benefit: Increase the cost of the "Life Insurance" benefit by $10.
3. Remove a benefit: Remove the "Vision Insurance" benefit from the "benefits" array.
4. Restructure the data: Move the "cost" and "coverage" properties into a nested object called "premium_info".
5. Add a new property: Add a new property called "expiration_date" to the insurance plan object with a sample date.

Note: The JSON object is already in an array, so you will need to handle that when restructuring the data.
