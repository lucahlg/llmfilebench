# Modify and Extend a Product Specification JSON

## Objective:

The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a JSON object representing a product specification characteristic. You will add new properties, update existing values, and restructure part of the JSON.


## Exercise Instructions:
You are provided with a JSON file describing a product specification characteristic. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a New Value:** Append a new "productSpecCharacteristicValue" object to the JSON. This new value should represent an additional color option for the product and have the following structure:
    ```json
    "productSpecCharacteristicValue": {
        "id": "product-spec-characteristic-value-2", 
        "valueType": {
            "id": "product-spec-characteristic-value-type-1",
            "name": "String"
        },
        "value": "Blue"
    }
    ```

2. **Update the Implementation Date:** Change the "implementationDate" to "2023-04-15".

3. **Add a Description:**  Insert a new property called "description" at the top level of the JSON object. This description should provide a brief explanation of the product specification characteristic. Set its value to: 
    ```json
    "description": "Specifies the color options available for this product."
    ```

4. **Modify Implementation Constraint:** Update the "implementationConstraint"  to: "Must be implemented on all new products starting April 15th, 2023".
