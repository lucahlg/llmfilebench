# Modify and Manage a Todo List JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and manage a todo list JSON object by adding new tasks, updating existing task details, reorganizing task priority, and removing completed tasks.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a todo list. Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new task to the "tasks" array with the following details:
    - title: "Practice coding"
    - description: "I need to practice coding for my new job."
    - priority: "high"
    - due_date: "2023-03-15"
    - completed: false
2. Update the priority of the task with id "1" from "high" to "medium".
3. Remove the completed task with title "Learn JSON". The task should be removed entirely, including its details.
4. Change the description of the task with title "Build a website" to include an additional requirement: "I also want to make it mobile-friendly."
5. Add a new field called "tags" to each task in the "tasks" array. For example:
    - The first task should have tags: ["learning", "json"]
    - The second task should have tags: ["web development", "portfolio"]
    - The third task should have tags: ["job search", "career goals"]

## Bonus Task:

Consider adding a new field called "reminder" to each task in the "tasks" array. If you choose to do this, include an additional reminder for one of the tasks. For example:
    - The first task should be reminded 3 days before its due date.
