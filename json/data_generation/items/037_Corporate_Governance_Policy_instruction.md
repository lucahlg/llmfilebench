# Modify and Extend a Corporate Governance Policy JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a corporate governance policy JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a company's corporate governance policy.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Executive Compensation**: Increase the base salary to $1100000 and add a new benefit called "education assistance" worth $20000.
2. **Change Supermajority Requirements**: Update the supermajority requirements for mergers and acquisitions by adding an additional condition: "approval from at least 75% of shareholders present".
3. **Add New Audit Committee Member**: Add a new member to the audit committee with the following details:
	* Name: Jane Smith
	* Qualifications: CPA, expert in financial regulations
4. **Reorganize Governance Structure**: Move the "nominationCommittee" and "compensationCommittee" into separate nested objects under the main "corporateGovernancePolicy" object.
5. **Remove Redundant Information**: Remove any redundant or unnecessary information from the JSON object, such as removing the "independenceRequirements" for the audit committee since they are already specified in the parent "boardComposition" object.

## Example Use Case:
This exercise will help you practice modifying and extending a complex JSON object by adding new properties, updating existing values, and reorganizing the structure. It will also require you to think critically about the relationships between different pieces of information within the JSON object.
