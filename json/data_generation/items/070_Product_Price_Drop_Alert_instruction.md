Here is a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend an E-commerce Product JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a product's information by adding, updating, and removing properties in both the "product" and "alert" objects. Your tasks are as follows:

1. Update the "price" property in the "product" object to $999.99 USD (no change, but ensure decimal places are handled correctly).
2. Add a new field called "description" to the "product" object with the following content:
    - A short description of the product.
3. In the "alert" object, update the "email" field to use a more secure format (e.g., "johndoe+alerts@example.com").
4. Add a new property called "sms" to the "alert" object with the following details:
    - The phone number associated with this alert: "+1 555-1234"
5. Change the "active" status in the "alert" object to false, indicating that no further price alerts will be sent for this product.
6. Remove the "productId" field from the "alert" object, as it is redundant.

Note: Ensure that any changes made are correctly formatted and follow standard JSON syntax.
