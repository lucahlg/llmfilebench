# Refine and Analyze a New Product Development Strategy

## Objective:

This exercise focuses on manipulating and refining a JSON object representing a detailed new product development strategy. You will modify existing data, add new information, and restructure elements to gain a deeper understanding of the strategic planning process. 

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file outlining the "New Product Development Strategy" for a fictional company. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Pricing:** Modify the `pricingStrategy` within the `product` section. Instead of "The Acme Widget will be priced at a premium to other widgets on the market," describe a more specific pricing model, such as  “Value-based pricing based on competitive analysis and target customer willingness to pay."

2. **Add a New Milestone:** Insert a new milestone after “Create product prototype” within the `milestones` array. This new milestone should be named "Conduct User Testing" with a description of "Gather feedback from a diverse group of potential users on the product prototype's usability, features, and overall appeal." Set its due date to "2023-06-15".

3. **Expand Risk Analysis:** Within the `risks` array, add two new potential risks:
    *  "Unexpected supply chain disruptions may delay production."
    * "Rapid technological advancements in the widget industry could render the Acme Widget obsolete."

4. **Enhance Mitigation Strategies:** For each of the newly added risks in step 3, develop corresponding mitigation strategies and append them to the `mitigationStrategies` array.


5. **Calculate Return on Investment (ROI):**  Add a new key-value pair to the `financialProjections` object within the `product` section. Calculate the ROI using the formula: (Profit / Budget) * 100 and name this new key "returnOnInvestment".
