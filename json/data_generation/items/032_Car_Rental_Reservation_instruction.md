# Modify and Analyze a Car Rental Reservation

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and analyze information within a JSON object representing a car rental reservation. You will update values, add new details, and calculate a key metric.


## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing data for a car rental reservation. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Extend the Reservation Details:** Add a new property called "pickup_time" to the JSON object. Set its value to "10:00 AM".

2. **Update Customer Information:** The customer's phone number has changed. Update the "phone_number" field in the "customer" object to "555-987-6543".

3. **Calculate Daily Rate:** Determine the daily rental rate by dividing the "total_cost" by the "rental_days". Store this calculated value as a new property called "daily_rate" within the JSON object.

4. **Modify Insurance Status:** The customer has decided to waive insurance coverage. Set the "insurance" property to false.
