Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend a Research Request JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a research request JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a research request.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Principal Investigator Information**: Update Dr. John Smith's affiliation in the "principalInvestigator" object to "University of California, San Francisco".
2. **Add New Research Output**: Add a new research output to the "researchOutputs" array with the following details:
	* Type: "poster"
	* Title: "The Impact of Genetic Variants on Disease Progression"
	* Authors: ["Dr. Jane Doe", "Dr. John Smith"]
	* Presentation Date: "2025-03-15"
	* Link: "https://www.researchgate.net/poster/123456789"
3. **Modify Data Request**: Update the timeframe for data request in the "dataRequest" object to include data from "2010-01-01" to "2025-12-31".
4. **Remove Unnecessary Properties**: Remove the "requestNumber" property from the JSON object.
5. **Restructure Organization Information**: Move the contact person and email address into a separate "contactInfo" object within the "requestingOrganization" object.

This exercise requires manipulation of the existing JSON structure, adding new properties, updating values, removing unnecessary information, and reorganizing data to meet specific requirements.
