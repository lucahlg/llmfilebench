# Modify and Enhance a Medical Device Manual

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and enhance a medical device manual JSON object by adding new properties, updating existing values, and reorganizing the structure.

## Exercise Instructions:
You are provided with a JSON file representing a user manual for a blood pressure monitor. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new publication resource**: Add a new entry to the "publicationResources" array with the following details:
    - language: "fr-FR"
    - size: 14567
    - url: "https://example.com/user-manual-fr-FR.pdf"
    - contentType: "application/pdf"
    - creationDate: "2023-03-10T14:00:00Z"

2. **Update the software version**: Update the "softwareVersion" property to reflect a newer version of the device's firmware.

3. **Restructure the sections**: Move the "sections" array into a nested object called "contentStructure" with the following structure:
```
{
    "introduction": {
        "title": "Introduction",
        "content": "This user manual provides instructions on how to use the Acme Blood Pressure Monitor."
    },
    "gettingStarted": {
        "title": "Getting Started",
        "content": "To get started, insert the batteries into the device and turn it on."
    },
    // Add new section structure here
}
```
4. **Add a new intended audience**: Update the "intendedAudience" property to include a new demographic: "Caregivers".

5. **Remove redundant information**: Remove any redundant or unused properties from the JSON object, making sure it remains readable and maintainable.

Note: The above exercise instruction has 5 steps for you to modify and enhance the given JSON object. Good luck!
