# Analyze and Update Acme Corporation's Diversity & Inclusion Policy

## Objective:

This exercise aims to enhance your understanding of JSON data manipulation by focusing on analyzing, updating, and restructuring elements within a company's diversity and inclusion policy document.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing Acme Corporation's Diversity and Inclusion Policy. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new policy element:** Introduce a new element to the "policyElements" array titled "Inclusive Language Guidelines." The description for this element should be: "Acme Corporation promotes the use of inclusive language in all internal and external communications to ensure a respectful and welcoming environment for everyone."
2. **Update an existing description:** Modify the description for the "Diversity and Inclusion Training" element to emphasize its role in fostering cultural awareness and empathy among employees. 
3. **Remove outdated information:** Delete the "Affirmative Action" element from the "policyElements" array, as Acme Corporation has transitioned to a more proactive approach focused on equity and inclusion.


4.  **Structure the policy statement:** Extract the "policyStatement" from its current location and embed it within a new object called "overview". This "overview" object should also include a field named "datePublished" containing the value of the existing "date" field.

5. **Rename a key:** Change the name of the "company" key to "organization".
