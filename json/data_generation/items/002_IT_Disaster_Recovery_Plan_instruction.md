Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Enhance a Disaster Recovery Plan JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and enhance a disaster recovery plan (DRP) JSON object by adding new sections, updating existing values, and reorganizing the structure.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a DRP. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new section:** Add a new section called "Risks and Threats" to the DRP JSON object. The "Risks and Threats" section should contain a list of potential risks and threats to the IT infrastructure, including:
	* Cyber attacks
	* Natural disasters
	* Power outages
	* Human error
2. **Update an existing procedure:** Update the "Backup and Recovery Procedures" to include a new step for verifying the integrity of backups.
3. **Modify the communication plan:** Update the "communication_plan" section to reflect changes in the company's communication channels, including adding "WhatsApp" as a notification method.
4. **Reorganize the roles and responsibilities:** Move the "roles_and_responsibilities" section into a nested object called "team_members", with the following structure:
```json
"team_members": {
    "IT Manager": [
        "Overall responsibility for the DRP.",
        "Coordinating the implementation and testing of the DRP.",
        "Reviewing and updating the DRP on a regular basis."
    ],
    "System Administrator": [
        "Maintaining and updating the IT infrastructure.",
        "Implementing and testing the DRP procedures.",
        "Providing technical support during a disaster."
    ],
    ...
}
```
5. **Remove an outdated procedure:** Remove the "Recovery Procedures" from the list of procedures, as it is no longer relevant.
6. **Add a new evaluation criterion:** Add a new evaluation criterion to the "testing_and_exercising" section for assessing the effectiveness of communication during a test.
7. **Update the maintenance and review schedule:** Update the "maintenance_and_review" section to reflect changes in the company's business operations, including increasing the frequency of DRP reviews to quarterly.

Note: The above instructions are designed to test your ability to modify and enhance the given JSON object, while also ensuring that the resulting JSON is still valid and consistent with the original structure.
