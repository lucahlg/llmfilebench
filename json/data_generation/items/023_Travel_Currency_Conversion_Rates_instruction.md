# Working with Currency Exchange Rates

## Objective:

This exercise aims to familiarize you with manipulating JSON data, specifically a JSON object representing currency exchange rates. You will be performing tasks such as updating values, adding new currency conversions, and restructuring parts of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing exchange rate information for the US Dollar (USD).

1. **Update an Existing Rate:** The exchange rate for GBP (British Pound) has changed to 0.78. Update the corresponding value in the "rates" object.
2. **Add a New Currency:** Add a new currency conversion for Canadian Dollars (CAD) with a rate of 1.35.
3. **Remove a Currency:** Remove the exchange rate information for JPY (Japanese Yen) from the "rates" object.

4. **Restructure Timestamp:** Extract the timestamp value and store it as a separate property called `"lastUpdated"` at the root level of the JSON object.
