# Analyze and Modify a Twitter Post JSON

## Objective:

The goal of this exercise is to analyze and modify a JSON object representing a Twitter post by extracting specific information, updating values, and adding new properties.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a tweet. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Extract Tweet Text:** Write code that extracts the text content of the tweet from the "content" object and stores it in a separate variable. Print this extracted text to the console.
2. **Calculate Engagement Rate:** Calculate the engagement rate of the tweet by dividing the total number of likes, comments, and shares (170) by the number of followers (which is not provided in the JSON but assumed to be 5000). Store the calculated engagement rate as a percentage in a variable and print it to the console.
3. **Add Hashtag Count:** Add a new property called "hashtag_count" to the tweet's content object.  Count the number of hashtags present in the tweet text and store this count in the "hashtag_count" property. 
4. **Update Profile Image:** Change the URL of the author's profile image to: `"https://example.com/new_profile_image.jpg"`.
