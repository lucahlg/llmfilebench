# Modify and Restructure a Package JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and restructure a JSON object representing a delivery package by updating existing information, adding new properties, and reorganizing the structure.

## Exercise Instructions: 

You are provided with a JSON file describing a delivery package. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Contact Information:** Change the "contact" number for the passenger to "+9876543210".

    `[30, 20, 15]`

3. **Restructure Destination:** Move the "destination" object into a new property called "deliveryAddress".

4. **Update Package Description:** Modify the existing "description" to include information about the package's weight:
