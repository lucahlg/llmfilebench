Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend Hospital Facilities Data

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend hospital facilities data by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing Springfield General Hospital's facilities.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new floor**: Add a new floor to the "floors" array with the following details:
    - floor_number: 3
    - rooms: An empty list initially, which will be populated with new rooms in subsequent steps.
2. Modify an existing room: Update the equipment in Room 101 (floor 1) by adding a new piece of equipment called "Defibrillator".
3. Restructure the data: Move the "address" field from the root object to a nested object called "hospital_info". The "hospital_info" object should contain:
    - name
    - address
4. Remove redundant information: Remove all room numbers from the JSON object.
5. **Add new equipment to multiple rooms**: Add a new piece of equipment called "Oxygen Tank" to Rooms 101, 201, and 203 (with quantities 2, 1, and 2 respectively).

This exercise will test your students' ability to manipulate and extend complex JSON data by adding new properties, updating existing values, removing redundant information, and reorganizing the structure.
