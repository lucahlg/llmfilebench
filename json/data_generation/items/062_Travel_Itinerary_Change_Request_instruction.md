# Process a Flight Change Request

## Objective:

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file containing information about a traveler's request to modify their flight booking. 

**Your tasks are:**

1. **Extract Traveler Details:** Create two new variables, `travelerName` and `travelerEmail`, storing the name and email address of the traveler from the `travelerInfo` object.
2. **Update Flight Information:**  Modify the `flightChangeRequest` object:
    - Change the `flightNumber` to "BA456".
