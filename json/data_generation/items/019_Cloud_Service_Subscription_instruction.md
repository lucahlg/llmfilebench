Here's a new exercise instruction for the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend a GKE Hub Subscription JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a GKE Hub subscription JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a GKE Hub subscription.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add new authentication configuration**: Add a new property called "additionalAuthConfigs" to the authConfig object. The additionalAuthConfigs should contain the following:
    - type: "API Key"
    - apiKey: "my-api-key"
2. **Update membership state and status**: Update the "membershipState" to "INACTIVE" and update the "status" property to "DEGRADED".
3. **Remove cloud state data**: Remove the entire "cloudStateData" object from the JSON.
4. **Restructure authentication configuration**: Move the "issuerUrl" field into a nested object called "workloadIdentityProviders" with the structure:
    json
    {
        "providers": [
            {
                "membership": "projects/my-project/locations/global/memberships/my-membership",
                "issuerUrl": "https://my-issuer-url.com"
            }
        ]
    }

This exercise requires you to understand JSON manipulation, addition of new properties, and restructuring of existing data. Good luck!
