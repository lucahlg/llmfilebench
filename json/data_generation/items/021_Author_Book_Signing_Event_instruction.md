# Modify and Enhance a Book Club Meeting JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and enhance a book club meeting JSON object by adding new properties, updating existing values, reorganizing the structure, and performing data validation.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a book club meeting. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update Meeting Details**: Update the "startDate" and "endDate" to reflect that the meeting will now take place on March 15th of this year. Ensure that the dates are in the format "YYYY-MM-DD".
2. **Add Speaker Information**: Add a new property called "speakers" to the JSON object. The "speakers" array should contain two objects with the following details:
    - speaker1: 
        - name: "John Smith"
        - bio: "Author of several novels and short stories."
    - speaker2: 
        - name: "Jane Doe"
        - bio: "Local poet and playwright."
3. **Validate ISBN**: Update the "isbn" property to ensure it conforms to the standard ISBN-13 format (13 digits, no spaces or hyphens). If validation fails, replace the existing value with a valid one.
4. **Remove Unnecessary Properties**: Remove the redundant "endTime" property from the JSON object.
5. **Restructure Venue Data**: Move the "name" field out of the nested "venue" object and into a top-level property called "meetingName". Keep the rest of the venue data within the "venue" object.

## Bonus Task (Optional):
Create a custom validation function to ensure that all dates and times in the JSON object are correctly formatted. Implement this function and demonstrate its usage by validating the existing date and time values in the JSON object.
