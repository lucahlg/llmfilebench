Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Extend a Policy JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a company policy JSON object by adding, updating, and removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a whistleblower protection policy.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new reporting mechanism**: Add a new reporting mechanism called "Anonymous online form" to the existing list of "reportingMechanisms".
2. **Update policy applicability**: Update the "applicability" field to include only "All employees", removing the references to "Managers" and "Executives".
3. **Modify protection measures**: Remove the "Non-retaliation policy" from the "protectionMeasures" list, as it's already implied by the confidentiality clause.
4. **Restructure investigation process**: Move the "initialAssessment", "fullInvestigation", and "conclusionAndReporting" steps into separate nested objects within the "investigationProcess" object. The structure should be:
    ```json
    {
        "investigationProcess": {
            "steps": [
                {
                    "stepName": "Initial Assessment",
                    "description": "The initial report will be assessed to determine if it warrants a full investigation."
                },
                {
                    "stepName": "Full Investigation",
                    "description": "If a full investigation is warranted, it will be conducted by an independent investigator."
                },
                {
                    "stepName": "Conclusion and Reporting",
                    "description": "The findings of the investigation will be reported to the appropriate authorities."
                }
            ]
        }
    }
```
5. **Modify policy description**: Update the "policyDescription" field to include a brief mention of the importance of anonymity in reporting.

Your goal is to create a modified JSON object that meets these requirements while maintaining the original structure and content where possible.
