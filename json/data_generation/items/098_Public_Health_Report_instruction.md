Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

**# Modify and Extend a Medical Report JSON Object**

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a medical report JSON object by adding new properties, updating existing values, and reorganizing the structure.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a medical report.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add new symptoms**: Add two new symptoms to the "symptoms" array in the "condition" object. The new symptoms should be:
    - "shortness of breath"
    - "fatigue"
2. **Update patient information**: Update the "age" property in the "person" object to 36.
3. **Add a new field to the condition object**: Add a new field called "severity" to the "condition" object with the value "moderate".
4. **Reorganize the report data**: Move the "date", "reporter", and "notes" fields into a nested object called "metadata" within the top-level "person" object.
5. **Remove redundant information**: Remove the "gender" field from the "person" object, as it is not essential for this medical report.

## Deliverables:
Your modified JSON file should meet all the requirements specified above.

Note: As with any programming exercise, please ensure that your students understand the requirements and provide a clear and concise solution.
