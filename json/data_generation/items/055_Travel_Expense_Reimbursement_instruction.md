Here's an exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

**Exercise: Modifying and Analyzing Employee Expenses**

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and analyze a JSON object representing employee expenses. You will be asked to add, update, remove, and restructure data in the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing an employee's business trip expenses. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Add a new category**: Add a new expense category called "Travel" to the "expenses" array. The "travel" expense should have a description, amount, and receipt.
2. **Update the total cost**: Update the "total" property in the JSON object to reflect the actual cost of the expenses.
3. **Remove an unnecessary field**: Remove the "notes" field from the JSON object as it is not necessary for reimbursement purposes.
4. **Reorganize the data**: Move the "employee" object into a nested object called "business_trip_info" with the following structure:
```json
"business_trip_info": {
  "name": "Alice Smith",
  "department": "Marketing"
}
```
5. **Analyze the expenses**: Calculate and display the average expense amount for each category (Transportation, Accommodation, Meals, Miscellaneous, Travel) in the JSON output.

**Note:** You will need to update your code to perform these modifications and display the calculated average expense amounts.

Have fun with this exercise!
