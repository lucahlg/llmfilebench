# Modify and Add Details to a Product JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and add details to a product JSON object by adding new properties, updating existing values, and reorganizing the structure.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a product. Your tasks are as follows:

1. **Update product specifications**: Update the "productSpecifications" array to include a new specification called "Operating System". The new specification should have the name "Operating System" and the value "Android 11".
2. **Add a warranty detail**: Add a new property called "warrantyPeriod" to the product object with a value of 2 years.
3. **Change the category**: Update the "productCategory" property from "Electronics" to "Gadgets".
4. **Remove an unimportant specification**: Remove the "Camera" specification from the productSpecifications array, as it's not essential for this exercise.
5. **Restructure the product description**: Move the "productDescription" field into a nested object called "details" with the following structure:
```json
"details": {
  "description": "The Acme SuperWidget is the most advanced widget on the market...",
  "features": [
    "sleek design",
    "powerful processor",
    "long-lasting battery"
  ]
}
```
Note that you should keep the original content of the description in the "details" object, and split it into a list of features as specified.
