Here are 5 exercise instructions based on the given JSON object:

**# Manipulate and Extend a Podcast Episode JSON Object**

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and extend a podcast episode JSON object by adding new properties, updating existing values, and reorganizing the structure.

## Exercise Instructions:

1. **Add a new chapter**: Add a new chapter called "Conclusion" to the "chapters" array with the following details:
	* title: "Elon Musk wraps up his conversation with Joe Rogan."
	* url: the same as the previous chapters (https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-joe-rogan-experience/id360084250?i=1000551763766#t={timestamp})
	* timestamps: add two new timestamp objects to the "timestamps" array with the following details:
		+ time: 1800
		+ text: "Joe Rogan asks Elon Musk about his final thoughts."
		+ time: 2000
		+ text: "Elon Musk thanks Joe Rogan for having him on the show."

2. **Update episode metadata**: Update the "episodeTitle" field to reflect a more accurate title of the podcast episode.

3. **Add new podcast information**: Add a new property called "podcastDescription" to the JSON object with a brief description of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast.

4. **Restructure chapter timestamps**: Move the "timestamps" array from each chapter into a separate nested object called "chapter_timestamps". The chapter_timestamps object should contain an array of timestamp objects, just like before.

5. **Remove unnecessary fields**: Remove any unnecessary fields or properties from the JSON object to make it more concise and easier to read.

Note: I tried to create a variety of tasks that would require different types of modifications, such as adding new data, updating existing values, reorganizing structure, etc.
