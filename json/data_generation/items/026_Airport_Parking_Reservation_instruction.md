Here's a new exercise instruction based on the given JSON object:

# Modify and Update a Parking Reservation JSON Object

## Objective:
The goal of this exercise is to modify and update a parking reservation JSON object by adding, updating, or removing properties. You will also be asked to restructure part of the JSON.

## Exercise Instructions:

You are provided with a JSON file representing a parking reservation.
Your tasks are as follows:

1. Add a new property called "driver" to the JSON. The driver should have an object containing the following fields:
    - "name": "John Smith"
    - "phoneNumber": "555-1234"
2. Update the parking space details: Change the parking space type from "standard" to "premium", and make it handicap accessible.
3. Remove the unnecessary fields from the JSON object, including "additionalInstructions".
4. Restructure the data: Move the "vehicle" field into a nested object called "driver_info" with the structure:
```
{
  "make": "Toyota",
  "model": "Camry",
  "year": 2020,
  "licensePlateNumber": "123ABC"
}
```
5. Update the payment info: Change the expiration date of the credit card to "2030-06-30".

Note that I've tried to create tasks that require a mix of addition, modification, and removal of properties, as well as restructuring of data. The goal is to help students practice working with JSON objects in a real-world scenario!
