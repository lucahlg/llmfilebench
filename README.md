# LLM File Bench

Welcome to the LLM File Bench repository. This project aims to benchmark the performance of Large Language Model (LLM) powered coding assistants, such as OpenHands, in modifying and manipulating structured files like JSON, XML, and HTML.

## Overview

The primary goal of this repository is to evaluate how effectively LLM-powered assistants can handle various tasks involving structured data files. This includes:

- Modifying JSON, XML or HTML files

## Tasks

All tasks and data were generated using GPT4o. The prompts can be found in the data_generation folder.

### JSON

Each task consists of a JSON file and an instruction file. The instruction file contains a list of tasks to be performed on the JSON file. 

## Status

This repository is in a very early stage. Contributions and feedback are welcome.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the relevant benchmark scripts.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lucahlg/llmfilebench.git
